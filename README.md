# Sirma Academy Exercises

## Description

This repository contains a series of coding exercises I completed as part of my coursework at Sirma Academy. The exercises span across fundamental programming concepts, advanced JavaScript, web development, React, backend development, and databases. The exercises are designed to strengthen fundamental programming skills and provide hands-on experience with various development concepts. The focus of the course was on understanding core principles and applying problem-solving techniques rather than just following templates.
