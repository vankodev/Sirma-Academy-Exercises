# Sirma Academy Exercises

## Description

This repository contains a series of coding exercises I completed as part of my coursework at Sirma Academy. The exercises span across fundamental programming concepts, advanced JavaScript, web development, React, backend development, and databases. The exercises are designed to strengthen fundamental programming skills and provide hands-on experience with various development concepts. The focus of the course was on understanding core principles and applying problem-solving techniques rather than just following templates. 

## Skills Acquired

- Strong understanding of fundamental programming concepts including **syntax**, **control flow**, and **data structures**
- Proficiency in advanced JavaScript techniques such as **objects**, **classes**, **inheritance**, and **asynchronous programming**
- Competence in web development using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **DOM manipulation**
- Experience with **React**, including **components**, **hooks**, and **routing**
- Familiarity with **backend development** using **Node.js** and **Express**
- Working knowledge of **databases**, both **NoSQL** and **SQL**
- Practical experience with **version control** using **Git** and related practices
